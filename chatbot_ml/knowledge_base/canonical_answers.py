CANONICAL_ANSWERS = {
    "what_is_dengue": (
        "Dengue fever is a viral disease caused by the dengue virus. "
        "It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes."
    ),

    "how_dengue_spreads": (
        "Dengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. "
        "It does not spread directly from person to person."
    ),

    "which_mosquito": (
        "Dengue is mainly spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, "
        "which commonly lives near human homes."
    ),

    "breeding_sites": (
        "Dengue mosquitoes breed in stagnant water found in containers, "
        "tanks, buckets, and uncovered water storage."
    ),

    "why_after_monsoon": (
        "Dengue cases increase after monsoon because rainwater creates "
        "many mosquito breeding sites around homes."
    ),

    "urban_risk": (
        "Dengue is common in urban areas due to high population density "
        "and the presence of stagnant water where mosquitoes breed."
    ),

    "person_to_person": (
        "Dengue does not spread directly from person to person. "
        "It spreads only through mosquito bites."
    ),
    "symptoms_general": (
    "Common symptoms of dengue include fever, headache, muscle pain, "
    "joint pain, and fatigue. Symptoms vary from person to person."
),

"prevention_basic": (
    "Dengue prevention focuses on avoiding mosquito bites and reducing "
    "standing water where mosquitoes can breed."
),

"environmental_risk": (
    "Poor sanitation and uncovered water containers increase the risk "
    "of dengue by providing mosquito breeding sites."
),

"public_health_problem": (
    "Dengue is a public health problem because it spreads rapidly, "
    "affects large populations, and can overwhelm healthcare systems during outbreaks."
),

"seasonal_outbreaks": (
    "Dengue outbreaks are seasonal because mosquito populations increase "
    "during warm and rainy periods."
),

"summer_rise": (
    "Dengue cases rise in summer because higher temperatures help mosquitoes "
    "breed faster and transmit the virus more efficiently."
),

"tropical_regions": (
    "Dengue is more common in tropical regions due to warm climates, "
    "frequent rainfall, and suitable conditions for mosquito breeding."
),

"climate_effect": (
    "Climate affects dengue spread by influencing temperature and rainfall, "
    "which directly impact mosquito survival and breeding."
),

"urban_control_difficulty": (
    "Dengue control is difficult in cities due to dense populations, "
    "unplanned housing, and widespread mosquito breeding sites."
),

"vector_borne": (
    "Dengue is called a vector-borne disease because it is transmitted "
    "to humans through mosquito bites."
),

"community_risk_reduction": (
    "Dengue risk can be reduced by removing standing water, "
    "covering water containers, and controlling mosquito breeding sites."
),

"clean_water_storage": (
    "Clean water storage is important because uncovered containers "
    "can become mosquito breeding sites."
),

"waste_management": (
    "Proper waste management helps prevent dengue by reducing places "
    "where water can collect and mosquitoes can breed."
),

"cover_containers": (
    "Covering water containers prevents mosquitoes from laying eggs "
    "and reduces dengue risk."
),
