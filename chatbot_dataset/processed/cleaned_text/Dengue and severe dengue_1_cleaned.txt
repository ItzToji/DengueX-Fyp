Recovery from infection by one dengue virus provides lifelong immunity against that particular virus serotype. However, this immunity confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three serotypes of the virus. Evidence suggests that sequential infection increases the risk of developing severe dengue. The time interval between infections and the particular viral sequence of infections may also be of importance. WHO recommends the use of Q-denga (TAK-003) in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high intensity of dengue transmission. Mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus often live in and around the home and in the garden. People should: wear clothing that covers the body well (especially the legs and feet); keep mosquitoes out of the house by placing insect screens over doors and windows; apply insect repellents according to the manufacturer’s label instructions; sleep under a net, during the day; take extra precautions to prevent transmission if a family member is infected by avoiding mosquito bites; and clean the surroundings and prevent water stagnation in and around homes. + Fact sheets + Questions and answers Databases and tools NTD roadmap tracker Global dengue surveillance dashboard + Disease outbreak news + Initiatives and groups + Resolutions and decisions + Technical work https://www.who.int/health-topics/dengue-and-severe-dengue#tab=tab_3 2/13
