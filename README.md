# 🩸 DengueX – AI-Powered Dengue Awareness & Forecasting System

## 📘 Overview
**DengueX** is an AI-based health information and analytics system developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP 2025)**.  
It combines **machine learning**, **data visualization**, and **public engagement** to assist in the **early detection, awareness, and prevention of dengue outbreaks**.

## 💡 Why DengueX Matters
Dengue fever continues to be a major health challenge in Pakistan and other tropical regions.  
Public misinformation, delayed detection, and poor awareness often lead to severe cases and fatalities.

**DengueX** addresses this by providing:
- A **medical-grade chatbot** that answers dengue-related queries in **English and Roman Urdu**
- A **forecasting dashboard** for dengue case trends and analysis  
- A **community-based mosquito breeding reporting system** to support early intervention  

Our goal is to **empower the public and health authorities** through data-driven insights and accessible AI support.
